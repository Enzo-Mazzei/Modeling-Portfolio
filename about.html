        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Enzo Mazzei, a 19-year-old with a passion for modeling. My journey into the world of modeling has been a thrilling adventure, and I'm excited to share it with you. I'm currently living in Marseille and I am on the lookout for an agency to join in France, Switzerland, northern Italy, or northern Spain, moving around isn't a problem to me. My bilingual proficiency in both English and French, coupled with my conversational Spanish and Korean skills, allows me to connect with a diverse range of people and cultures, an asset I value greatly in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>All the tattoos on my body are temporary. I typically sport various tattoos around the clock, but I can easily remove them when necessary. Additionally, my height is 178cm. While you might notice green/gray eyes in some of my Instagram pictures, my natural eye color is dark.  </p>
        <p>  One unique aspect of my modeling portfolio is my proficiency in Photoshop. With seven years of experience, I've become adept at enhancing and editing photos, ensuring the final product reflects the best version of myself. Notably, all the photos taken in the enchanting backdrop of <a href=outside-pictures.html>Santorini</a> featured in my portfolio were meticulously edited by me.
        </p>
            <p>  At present, I don't limit myself to a specific style or niche. I believe in seizing every opportunity that comes my way, embracing the versatility that modeling offers. While I've had the privilege of working with Studio365 in Marseille for <a href=studio-pictures.html>some of my shoots</a>, it's important to note that my modeling journey is still in its developmental stages, and I'm focused on growth above all else.
            </p>
                <p>  You can follow my modeling adventures on my Instagram, linked in the menu of this website. Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey, and I can't wait to share more of my experiences with you in the future.
                </p>
